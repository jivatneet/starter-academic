abstract: "In many real-world scenarios where extrinsic rewards to the agent are extremely
sparse, curiosity has emerged as a useful concept providing intrinsic rewards that
enable the agent to explore its environment and acquire knowledge to achieve its
goals. Despite their strong performance on many sparse-reward tasks, existing
curiosity approaches rely on a holistic view of state transitions and do not allow
for a structured understanding of specific aspects of the environment. In this paper,
we formulate curiosity based on grounded question answering by encouraging the
agent to ask questions about the environment and be curious when the answers to
their questions change. We show that language questions encourage the agent to
uncover specific knowledge about their environment such as the physical properties
of objects as well as their spatial relationships with other objects, which serve as
valuable curiosity rewards to solve sparse-reward tasks more efficiently."
